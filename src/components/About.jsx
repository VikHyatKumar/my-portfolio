            Myself Vikhyat, a final-year Computer Science engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack
            development and problem-solving. I enjoy building clean, responsive user interfaces as well as
            scalable backend systems, working across the stack to deliver reliable and user-focused
            applications using modern web technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alongside full-stack development, I’m actively gaining hands-on experience with Python and AI agents, exploring how intelligent systems can automate workflows and integrate with real-world applications. I focus on learning through practical projects, experimentation, and continuous improvement.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m actively seeking internship or entry-level opportunities where I can learn from experienced engineers, contribute to real-world products, and grow as a software developer. I value collaboration, continuous learning, and building solutions that are reliable and impactful.
